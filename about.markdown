At musicalconfidence.com we break down the complicated process of music-making into a simple goal-system that teaches and demonstrates the basic elements of sound and music. Any effective learning system must be flexible and responsive to students needs, and for this reason we ask that any student interested in lessons please email us at nicholasdean@musicalconfidence.com with a brief or detailed explanation of what musical goals you would like help tackling. We will carefully review the information you send and we will design a goal-system for you to follow through to success. Curriculum will necessarily entail mastery over elemental musical concepts, and from there instruction is based on individual student preferences. Developing unique musical personalities full of passion, insight, and confidence so that you are equipped with tools enabling you to relax, have fun, and freely express yourself is what we’re all about. True confidence is leaning back on your strengths while stretching yourself towards new horizons of inspiration.
There is power in understanding that your strengths in addition to your weaknesses sum to create your own unique musical personality. This is where it pays to be honest with yourself -- what are limiting areas in your musical understanding and biomechanical technique? Sure those up. What are your strengths? Triple down on those. Developing your own style and sound on an instrument is a process that gradually happens over time but can be accelerated with the right focus and instruction. Figure out what area of study you would like to concentrate on and together we’ll blast through the barrier. Personal grit and focused commitment combined with effective coaching has the power to turbo boost your mindset and musical gains. So where would you like to take your playing?
Remember: the obstacle is the way! We are in business to help you break through your walls.
Have you been stuck on a musical plateau? Have you wanted to learn to make music but were too overwhelmed with where to start? Want to develop your own personal sound and express yourself with confidence and musicality? Reach out to us at nicholasdean@musicalconfidence.com.
